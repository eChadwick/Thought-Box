# What is Thought Box

_“The mind in its natural state can be compared to the sky, covered by layers of cloud which hide its true nature.” ~Kalu Rinpoche_

Thought-Box is philosophically, an application to store one’s thoughts and allow one to focus on what is immediately at hand.  It is a response to the dozen of post-it notes which often checker my desktop.  The idea is that one need only input the thought to Thought-Box and then it may be erased from the mind.  The app will provide easy functionality to categorize and prioritize the thought at a later time (Or not.  They are your thoughts, do with them as you will).

On a technical level, Thought-Box is essentially and enhanced list app.  Each thought is represented by a list item.  Thoughts can be uncategorized (like “Remember to pick up pet wombat from daycare”) or categorized (like “Bars/Restaurants that allow wombats”).  Categorized thoughts are also able to be prioritized within their category (for instance “acquire materials” would be of higher priority than “leash wombat” in the prioritized category “build wombat shelter”).  A thought is able to belong to multiple categories with different priorities in each category (for example “acquire materials” may be top priority in the “build wombat shelter” prioritized categorized but it may be below “feed wombat” in the prioritized category “today’s to-do list”. 

*Note - Prioritization of Thoughts in Categories will be added in a future release.
Future releases may include google maps integration for location based thoughts and reminder alerts for time dependent thoughts as well as UI customization.
